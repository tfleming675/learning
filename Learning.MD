# Learning Resource File Set

## Where to start
- [APIs for Beginners](https://youtu.be/GZvSYJDk-us) - This is a great starting point that helped me with the 50K level and then work thru the individual pieces. 
- [Web-hooks for Beginners](https://youtu.be/41NOoEz3Tzc) - Excellent course Craig has the heart of a teacher and the mind of a developer - perfect. Keep in mind I donâ€™t actually want to be a developer but I am trying to understand the craft and be able to communicate way with peers, customers and partners.
